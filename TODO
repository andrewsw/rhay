* convert to floating point colors

   convert to an internal representation [0.0-1.0] instead of [0-255] to
   allow future work with colors.

* implement shading
- first basic shading using cosine shading w/ ambient coefficient

* move PPM generation out of Main

* parse and read file representation of scenes

* make a mkCamera function

* make Cameras have a direction so the same scene can be viewed from
   different angles.
