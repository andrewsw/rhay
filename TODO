* move rendering out of Main, perhaps into Scene

   the renderer should be something like

   render :: Scene -> [Camera] -> [Image]

   looking ahead to the idea of multiple cameras

* create a Camera

   it should understand where it's located, its focal length, the size of
   its screen etc. It should also produce the rays it needs to draw
   the image so the renderer can ask the camera(s) for the rays.

* convert to floating point colors

   convert to an internal representation [0.0-1.0] instead of [0-255] to
   allow future work with colors.

* implement shading
- first basic shading using cosine shading w/ ambient coefficient

* move PPM generation out of Main

* parse and read file representation of scenes
